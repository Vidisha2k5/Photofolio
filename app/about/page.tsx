              I'm a passionate photographer with over 8 years of experience capturing 
              life's most precious moments. My journey began with a simple camera and 
              an insatiable curiosity about the world around me.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
              From intimate portraits to breathtaking landscapes, I believe every 
              photograph should tell a story. My approach combines technical expertise 
              with creative vision to create images that resonate with emotion and meaning.
